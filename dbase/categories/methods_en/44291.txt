  "text": "* `this.component()` - returns a component for this container, if it is in an array, it will return an array (pages), if the container itself is a component, it will return this;\r\n\r\n\r\n* `this.remove(withChild)` - deletes the container, if passed with the parameter withchild=true, also deletes child containers located in properties with the types: \"group\" and \"render-variant\", you can delete only the container located in the array (RenderType=\"container-inner\");\r\n\r\n\r\n* `this.setAllProps(MapObject)` - checks the `MapObject` object for matching keys with container properties and sets their value for all matched ones;\r\n\r\n* `.getAllProps(MapObject)` - returns data from all properties whose names match the names of keys in the MapObject object by calling the getProp(obg) method on each matched property,\r\nfor example MapObject={key1: \"\", key2: {ke1:\"\"} } will call key1.getProp(), key2.getProp({ke1: \"\"}). In this way, you can get an expanded object with the keys of which will be the names of the properties and the values - the data of these properties. If not passed to the MapObject method, it will create an object with all the properties from this container."
